This thing is designed to make small torsion springs with music wire of about 1mm in diameter. Similar commercial spring winders can be prohibitively expensive if you just need to make a few springs. With this design, you just need a piece of steel rod for a mandrel, some music wire, and you're set.

Directions:

* Drill/ream out the holes in the base and the handle.

* Insert a mandrel.

* Wind some springs!
